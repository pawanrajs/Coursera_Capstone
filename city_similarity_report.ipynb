    "### 1.1 City Comparison - Why do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why a comparison of different cities may be needed. For example:\n",
    "- Planning a vacation and trying to find cities to visit based on what cities you already have visited. This may be in the form of cities similar to the ones you have visited and enjoyed, or cities dissimilar to the ones you dislike (or even dissimilar to what you like if you are feeling adventurous!).\n",
    "- Narrowing down cities to move to, if you have multiple job offers in different cities, or before you decide to concentrate your job hunt in a specific city\n",
    "- Corporation looking to build a second headquarters, may want to compare cities to narrow down the candidate cities to a few options\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Focus of this project\n",
    "In this project, we focus on city comparison based on venues within the city, in order to recommend cities that users may want to visit based on cities that they tell us they have already visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses a combination of foursquare data and geocoding data to cluster cities by their similarity / dissimilarity to provided cities, in order to give users options based on their mood. Since cities picked for analysis are at random, it may uncover potential new exotic locations for users to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only is this helpful for potential travelers, but may also be offered as a service by travel agents or airline companies to funnel customers into their sales process.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this implementation is easily adapted to fulfil other needs as indicated in section 1.1"

In order to provide a meaninful comparison with a city like Amsterdam and New York - sample cities were filtered to only cities with more than 20 venues. In this particular case - that led to 70 cities out of 100. \n",
